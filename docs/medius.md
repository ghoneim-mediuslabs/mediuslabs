## **Portfolio**

### **1. Smart School Meals Platform** *(In Development)*

A mobile platform modernizing meal ordering and delivery for schools in Egypt.

**The Problem**
School meal logistics are fragmented—parents lack visibility, schools juggle coordination, and suppliers operate inefficiently.

**The Solution**
A unified platform connecting **parents**, **schools**, and **suppliers** with a simple model: each school partners with one dedicated supplier.

**How It Works**
- Parents browse menus, place same-day orders, and track fulfillment
- Schools monitor incoming orders and coordinate delivery
- Suppliers receive real-time requests and deliver directly to schools

**Why This Model**
- Consistent food quality
- Predictable delivery flows
- Simplified operations
- Trustworthy experience for parents

**Market**
Initial launch targets the **Egyptian school ecosystem**, where demand for convenience, safety, and reliable meal quality is growing.
