## **What We Do**

Medius operates as a **parent company** for a portfolio of software products. Each product is:

- **Independently operated** with dedicated teams
- **Built on shared infrastructure** for engineering, design, and operations

We don't build for clients. We build products we own and operate.

2. **Build** — Develop focused platforms that solve specific problems well
3. **Scale** — Grow products through disciplined execution and reinvestment

## **Portfolio**

### **1. School Meal Delivery Platform** *(In Development)*

A mobile platform for school meal ordering in **Egypt**. Each school is linked to exactly one assigned supplier—no marketplace, no complexity.

**The Problem**
- Parents lack time to prep healthy meals; kids resort to junk food
- Schools have no visibility on what students eat
- Suppliers can't predict daily demand

**The Solution**
- Parents order from their school's designated supplier
- Supplier prepares meals in batch and delivers to the school
- School distributes to students and confirms delivery
- Payment is released only after confirmation

**The Flow**
1. Parent orders before morning cutoff
2. Supplier receives aggregated orders, prepares, delivers to school
3. Floor admin distributes and confirms delivery
4. Payment auto-released to supplier

**Why It Works**
- **Parents**: Trusted menu, reliable process, no vendor confusion
- **Schools**: One supplier, commission revenue, quality control
- **Suppliers**: Predictable demand, batch efficiency, exclusive relationship
