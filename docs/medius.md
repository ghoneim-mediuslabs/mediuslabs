## **Our First Product: Smart School Meals Platform**

Medius is currently developing its first flagship product: a mobile platform that modernizes meal ordering and delivery for schools across Egypt.

### **Product Overview**

The platform connects three key stakeholders—**parents**, **schools**, and the school’s **assigned food supplier**—to streamline the daily process of selecting, ordering, preparing, and delivering meals to students.

Unlike open marketplaces that introduce complexity and logistical uncertainty, each school on our platform is partnered with **one dedicated supplier**. This ensures:

* **Consistent food quality**
* **Predictable, controlled delivery flows**
* **Simplified operations for schools and vendors**
* **A trustworthy, hassle-free ordering experience for parents**

### **How It Works**

* Parents browse menus, place same-day orders, and track fulfillment directly from their mobile app.
* Schools monitor incoming orders and coordinate with their assigned supplier.
* Suppliers receive real-time requests, prepare meals, and deliver directly inside the school.

The result is a reliable ecosystem where every stakeholder benefits from clarity, efficiency, and convenience.
