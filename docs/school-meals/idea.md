# **School Meal Delivery System — Updated Business Idea**

## **Overview**

A mobile platform that connects **parents**, **schools**, and each school’s **assigned food supplier** to streamline meal ordering and same-day delivery inside the school.

Unlike an open marketplace, **each school is linked to exactly one supplier**, ensuring consistency, controlled logistics, and simplified operations.

The target is the Egyptian market.

## **Core Problem**

Parents struggle with:

* Does not have time to prep healthy meals for students  
* Forgetting to pack lunch  
* Unhealthy last-minute alternatives because students end up buying things like borio, chips and pepsi  
* No visibility into meal delivery  
* Healthy meals usually cost more for parents but maybe suppliers can do it better because of scale

Students struggle with:

* Student can lose the pocket money  
* Usually break time is short and they don’t manage to buy anything

Schools struggle with:

* They have no visibility on the meals student get  
* \[maybe\] Schools do not have supplier registration up-to-date

Suppliers struggle with:

* Predicting daily demand  
* Managing orders without a system

Ministry of education struggle with:

* They have no visibility on the meals student get  
* No visibility on the spending on meals (مصروفات وإيرادات)

## **Solution**

A **school-specific meal ordering app** where:

* Parents order only from their school’s designated supplier  
* The supplier prepares the meals  
* The school handles internal delivery to students  
* Payment is released only after school confirms delivery

This creates a **controlled, predictable meal delivery workflow** with minimal complexity.

## **Key Stakeholders & Roles**

### **Parents**

* View their school’s supplier menu (no browsing other suppliers)  
* Place orders before the cutoff (2+ hours before 10 AM)  
* Pay online  
* Track food until it reaches the student

### **Schools**

* Have a fixed agreement with one supplier  
* Receive batched meals each morning  
* Deliver to the correct student or classroom  
* Confirm delivery through the app  
* Earn a fixed commission per order

### **Supplier (per school)**

* Upload the school’s menu, pricing, and availability  
* Accept & prepare daily orders  
* Deliver the full batch to the school each morning  
* Get paid only after school confirmation

### **Floor Admin**

* Receives order for supplier and confirm delivery

### **\[probably\] Ministry of Education**

## **How the Flow Works**

1. Parent opens the app → selects their student → sees the **school-linked menu**  
2. Parent places an order before the morning cutoff  
3. Supplier receives daily order list by school  
4. Supplier prepares and delivers all meals to the floor admin  
5. Floor admin distributes and confirms delivery  
6. Payment is released to the supplier automatically

This creates a clean, reliable **B2B2C loop** with stable relationships.
